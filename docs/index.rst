pyROX: Rapid Opacity X-sections
===============================

Welcome to the pyROX documentation! pyROX is a Python package for calculating opacity cross-sections for sub-stellar atmospheres. It can handle line opacities using various databases (ExoMol, HITRAN, Kurucz) and also supports the calculation of collision-induced absorption coefficients (HITRAN, Borysow).
